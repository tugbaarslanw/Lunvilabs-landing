    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <div class="legal-meta">
      Last updated: 25 Oct 2025<br/>
      Applies to: Lunvi Labs preview / early access
    </div>

    <p>
      These Terms of Service (“Terms”) describe how you may access and use
      Lunvi Labs. By requesting access, testing the product, or asking to
      upgrade a plan, you agree to these Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Beta / Preview nature</h2>
    <p>
      The current service is an early-access / beta service. Features may
      change, break, or be rate-limited. We may decline or revoke access at
      our discretion, especially if capacity is limited.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Intended use</h2>
    <p>
      Lunvi Labs is designed for legitimate analytics and advertising
      measurement use cases (for example: server-side Meta Conversions API,
      GA4 Measurement Protocol, consent-based tracking). You agree not to
      use the service to send illegal content, malicious payloads, or data
      you do not have a legal right to process.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Customer data</h2>
    <p>
      You may send us event data (e.g. purchase events, lead events) to be
      forwarded to ad/analytics destinations like Meta or Google. You are
      responsible for:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Having a lawful basis to collect and send that data</li>
      <li>Honoring end-user consent where required</li>
      <li>Not sending data that violates any applicable privacy law</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We will handle that data with commercially reasonable security and
      only process it to provide the service.
    </p>

    <h2>4. No absolute SLA (yet)</h2>
    <p>
      We aim for high uptime (target 99.9%) and low latency, but at this
      early stage we do not promise a formal SLA. Paid / production plans
      may include an SLA and Data Processing Agreement (DPA). Ask us if you
      need that.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Intellectual property</h2>
    <p>
      Lunvi Labs owns all service code, infrastructure, and branding.
      You keep all rights to your own data and your own trademarks.
      Granting us access to send your events does not transfer ownership
      of your data.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Termination</h2>
    <p>
      You can stop using the service at any time. We may suspend or
      terminate access for abuse, non-payment (when paid plans go live),
      security concerns, or legal reasons.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Liability</h2>
    <p>
      To the maximum extent permitted by law, Lunvi Labs is provided
      “as is”, without warranties of any kind, and our liability is
      limited to the amount you actually paid us for the service in the
      3 months before the issue.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Contact</h2>

    <p style="font-size:13px;color:rgba(255,255,255,.5);margin-top:40px;">
      We’ll update these Terms as we launch billing, SLAs and region-specific data
      processing agreements.
